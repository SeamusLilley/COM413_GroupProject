    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=A3:71:49:29:C9:8C:77:0C:D0:AC:5E:CD:87:02:F9:22:69:6F:1F:0B%3Bcom.example.groupproject

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    com.example.groupproject

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    A3:71:49:29:C9:8C:77:0C:D0:AC:5E:CD:87:02:F9:22:69:6F:1F:0B

    ^This might be different for your project
    If the map doesn't display, you may need to get a new api key using your own SHA-1
    To get yours, go to gradle (top right) -> tasks -> android -> singingReport
    The SHA-1 will be displayed
    Configure a key at console.developers.google.com in credentials
    You'll need to restrict it to com.example.groupproject and your SHA-1
    Copy the key that's generated and paste it where my key is

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
